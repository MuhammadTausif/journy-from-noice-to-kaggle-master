# Journy from Noice to Kaggle-Master

I have done several thought session to publish or not this topic due to following reasons:
1. I should not publish this topic because it is a self-proclamation, and self-praising, so, it must be avoided.
2. I should publish this topic because it may become motivation, and also help some other persons/kaggler to start or continue work for learning and earning purposes.

At the end, the second option becomes prevalant, and I am writting this text to benifet others even though reader may find self-proclamation somewhere, please ignore that point, or just bear it.


I joinded Kaggle few years ago for educational purposed, and did not continue it.
This thread is a breif description of my journey from noice to Kaggle Master in 6 month.
